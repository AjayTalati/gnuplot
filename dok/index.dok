======= Plotting Package Manual with Gnuplot =======
{{anchor:gnuplot.dok}}

A plotting package to visualize [[..:torch:index#Tensor|Tensor]] objects.
Functions fall into several types of categories:
  * [[#gnuplot.line.dok|Line plotting]]
  * [[#gnuplot.surface.dok|Plotting 3D surfaces]]
  * [[#gnuplot.image.dok|Plotting matrices as images]]
  * [[#gnuplot.histogram.dok|Plotting histogram of data]]
  * [[#gnuplot.files.dok|Plotting directly into files]]
  * [[#gnuplot.commons.dok|Common operations to decorate plots]]

The plotting package currently uses [[http://gnuplot.info|gnuplot]] as
a backend to display data. In particular, ''Gnuplot'' version ''4.4''
or above is suggested for full support of all functionality.

By default, plot package will search for terminal in following order
  * '' windows '' terminal if operating system is windows
  * '' wxt '', '' x11 ''  terminal if operating system is linux
  * '' aqua '', '' x11 '' terminal if operating system is mac

It is also possible to manually set any terminal type using
[[#gnuplot.setterm|gnuplot.setterm]]. Interactivity is
dependent on the terminal being used. By default, ''x11'' and ''wxt
support'' different interactive operations like, zooming, panning,
rotating...

The ''Gnuplot'' port uses ''pipes'' to communicate with ''gnuplot'',
therefore each plotting session is persistent and additional commands
can be sent. For advanced users [[#gnuplot.raw|gnuplot.raw]]
provides a free form interface to gnuplot.

===== Line Plotting =====
{{anchor:gnuplot.line.dok}}

Line plotting functionality covers many configurations from simplest
case of plotting a single vector to displaying multiple lines at once
with custom line specifictions.

====  gnuplot.plot(x) ====
{{anchor:gnuplot.plot}}
Plot vector '' x '' using dots of first default ''Gnuplot'' type.

<file lua>
x=torch.linspace(-2*math.pi,2*math.pi)
gnuplot.plot(torch.sin(x))
</file>
{{plot_x.png?400}}

In more general form, plot vector '' y vs x '' using the format
specified. The possible entries of format string can be
  * '.' for dots
  * '+' for points
  * '-' for lines
  * '+-' for points and lines
  * '~' for using smoothed lines with cubic interpolation
  * '|' for using boxes
  * 'v' for drawing vector fiels. (In this case, x and y have to two column vectors (x,xdelta),(y,ydelta))

<file lua>
x=torch.linspace(-2*math.pi,2*math.pi)
gnuplot.plot('Sin',x/math.pi,torch.sin(x),'|')
</file>
{{plot_xyf.png?400}}

To plot multiple curves at a time, one can pass each plot struct in a table.

<file lua>
x=torch.linspace(-2*math.pi,2*math.pi)
gnuplot.plot({'Cos',x/math.pi,torch.cos(x),'~'},{'Sin',x/math.pi,torch.sin(x),'|'})
</file>
{{plot_sincos.png?400}}

===== Plotting 3D Surfaces =====
{{anchor:gnuplot.surface.dok}}

Surface plotting creates a 3D surface plot of a given matrix '' z
''. Entries of '' z '' are used as height values. It is also possible
to specify '' x '' and '' y '' locations corresponding to each point
in '' z ''. If a terminal with interactive capabilities is being used
by ''Gnuplot'' backend (like ''x11'' or ''wxt''), then rotating,
zooming is also possible.

====  gnuplot.splot(z) ====
{{anchor:gnuplot.splot}}

Plot surface '' z '' in 3D.
<file lua>
x=torch.linspace(-1,1)
xx = torch.Tensor(x:size(1),x:size(1)):zero():addr(1,x,x)
xx = xx*math.pi*6
gnuplot.splot(torch.sin(xx))
</file>
{{plot_splot.png?400}}

It is also possible to specify the ''x'' and ''y'' locations of each
point in ''z'' by ''gnuplot.splot(x,y,z)''. In this ''x'' and ''y'' has
to be the same shape as ''z''.

One can also display multiple surfaces at a time.

<file lua>
x=torch.linspace(-1,1)
xx = torch.Tensor(x:size(1),x:size(1)):zero():addr(1,x,x)
xx = xx*math.pi*2
gnuplot.splot({torch.sin(xx)},{torch.sin(xx)+2})
</file>
{{plot_splot2.png?400}}

=====  Plotting Matrices as Images =====
{{anchor:gnuplot.image.dok}}

A given matrix can be plotted using 2D contour plot on a surface.

====  gnuplot.imagesc(z, ['color' or 'gray']) ====
{{anchor:gnuplot.imagesc}}

Plot surface '' z '' using contour plot. The second argument defines
the color palette for the display. By default, grayscale colors are
used, however, one can also use any color palette available in
''Gnuplot''.

<file lua>
x=torch.linspace(-1,1)
xx = torch.Tensor(x:size(1),x:size(1)):zero():addr(1,x,x)
xx = xx*math.pi*6
gnuplot.imagesc(torch.sin(xx),'color')
</file>
{{plot_imagesc.png?400}}

===== Histograms =====
{{anchor:gnuplot.histogram.dok}}

Given a tensor, the distribution of values can be plotted using
''gnuplot.hist'' function.

====  gnuplot.hist(x, [nbins, min, max]) ====
{{anchor:gnuplot.hist}}

Plot the histogram of values in ''N-D'' tensor ''x'', optionally using ''nbins''
number of bins and only using values between ''min'' and ''max''.

<file lua>
gnuplot.hist(torch.randn(100000),100)
</file>
{{plot_hist.png?400}}

===== Plotting Directly into Files =====
{{anchor:gnuplot.files.dok}}

Any of the above plotting utilities can also be used for directly
plotting into ''eps'' or ''png'' files. A final gnuplot.plotflush()
command ensures that all output is written to the file properly.

<file lua>
gnuplot.epsfigure('test.eps')
gnuplot.plot({'Sin Curve',torch.sin(torch.linspace(-5,5))})
gnuplot.xlabel('X')
gnuplot.ylabel('Y')
gnuplot.plotflush()
</file>

===== Common Operations =====
{{anchor:gnuplot.commons.dok}}

It is possible to manage multiple plots at a time, printing plots to
png, or eps files or creating plots directly on png or eps files.

There are also several handy operations for decorating plots which are
common to many of the plotting functions.


====  gnuplot.setgnuplotexe(exe) ====
{{anchor:gnuplot.setgnuplotexe}}

Manually set the location of gnuplot executable.

====  gnuplot.setterm(teerm) ====
{{anchor:gnuplot.setterm}}

Manually set the gnuplot terminal.

====  gnuplot.closeall() ====
{{anchor:gnuplot.closeall}}

Close all gnuplot active connections. This will not be able to close
open windows, since on the backend gnuplot also can not close windows.

====  gnuplot.figure([n]) ====
{{anchor:gnuplot.figure}}

Select (or create) a new figure with id ''n''. Note that until a plot
command is given, the window will not be created. When ''n'' is
skipped, a new figure is created with the next consecutive id.

====  gnuplot.epsfigure(fname) ====
{{anchor:gnuplot.epsfigure}}

Creates a figure directly on the ''eps'' file given with
''fname''. This uses ''Gnuplot'' terminal ''postscricpt eps enhanced color''.

====  gnuplot.pngfigure(fname) ====
{{anchor:gnuplot.pngfigure}}

Creates a figure directly on the ''png'' file given with
''fname''. This uses ''Gnuplot'' terminal ''png''.

====  gnuplot.plotflush([n]) ====
{{anchor:gnuplot.plotflush}}

This command sends ''unset output'' to underlying gnuplot. Usefull for
flushing file based terminals.

====  gnuplot.figprint(fname) ====
{{anchor:gnuplot.figprint}}

Prints the current figure to the given file with name ''fname''. Only
''png'' or ''eps'' files are supported.

====  gnuplot.xlabel(label) ====
{{anchor:gnuplot.xlabel}}

Sets the label of ''x'' axis to ''label''. Only supported for gnuplot
version 4.4 and above.

====  gnuplot.ylabel(label) ====
{{anchor:gnuplot.ylabel}}

Sets the label of ''y'' axis to ''label''. Only supported for gnuplot
version 4.4 and above.

====  gnuplot.zlabel(label) ====
{{anchor:gnuplot.zlabel}}

Sets the label of ''z'' axis to ''label''. Only supported for gnuplot
version 4.4 and above.

====  gnuplot.title(title) ====
{{anchor:gnuplot.title}}

Sets the title of the plot to ''title''. Only supported for gnuplot
version 4.4 and above.

====  gnuplot.grid(toggle) ====
{{anchor:gnuplot.grid}}

If ''toggle'' is ''true'' then a grid is displayed, else it is
hidden. Only supported for gnuplot version 4.4 and above.

====  gnuplot.movelegend(hloc,vloc) ====
{{anchor:gnuplot.movelegend}}

Set the location of legend key. ''hloc'' can be '''left', 'right' or
'center'''. ''vloc'' can be '''top', 'bottom' or 'middle'''. Only
supported for gnuplot version 4.4 and above.

==== gnuplot.axis(axis) ====
{{anchor:gnuplot.axis}}

Sets the properties of axis for the current plot.

  * ''auto'' : auto scales the axis to fit data and plot canvas
  * ''image'' : scales the axis aspect ratio so that a circle is drawn as circle.
  * ''equal'' : same as ''image''.
  * ''fill'' : resets the aspect ratio of the plot to original values so that it fills up the canvas as good as possible.
  * {xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax} : Sets the limits of x and y axes.

====  gnuplot.raw(command) ====
{{anchor:gnuplot.raw}}

This command is useful for advanced users of gnuplot. ''command'' is
directly passed to gnuplot without any formatting.
